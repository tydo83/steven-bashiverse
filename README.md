# Steven Bashiverse

An exercise in file-management BASH commands.


### Introduction

This lab is mostly about managing a file system by creating, moving, copying, and deleting files and directories from your system.

The rest of it is about how much I love [Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe).

### Project Workflow

* You'll start by forking this repository and cloning it.
* After that, you'll follow the steps below, `add`ing and `commit`ting after _every single step_. Once again, we're looking for a commit (which is recorded in your repo's history, so we can see it!) for every single numbered step below!
* What kind of commit messages should you have? For each step, as you write your commit message, give it a good description of what that commit accomplished. Even if these are very fine-grained commits, you can still describe the step you took!
* Feel free to `push` up as you go; you don't need to upload as you work, necessarily, just "save" your commits in your repository. But it's a good habit to get into, to push every once in a while... just in case! But however often you `push` up, be sure to do so before the assignment is due!


### Steps To Follow

1. Create files called:
   * `rose-quartz.md`
   * `pearl.md`
   * `amethyst.md`
   * `garnet.md`
   * `jasper.md`
   * `connie.md`
2. Create a directory called `opal` and _copy_ `pearl.md` and `amethyst.md` into it.
3. Create a directory called `sugilite` and _copy_ `garnet.md` and `amethyst.md` into it.
4. Create a directory called `sardonyx` and _copy_ `garnet.md` and `pearl.md` into it.
5. Create a directory called `alexandrite` and _copy_ `garnet.md`, `pearl.md`, and `amethyst.md`.
6. Create a directory called `bubbled-gems` and create a file called `bismuth.md` in it.
7. _Move_ `bismuth.md` into the root level of the repository.
8. Change the name of `rose-quartz.md` to `steven-universe.md`.
9. Create a file called `ruby.md` and another called `sapphire.md` and remove `garnet.md` from the root level.
10. Create a directory called `stevonnie` and _copy_ `steven-universe.md` and `connie.md` into it.
11. _Move_ `jasper.md` to `bubbled-gems` and `bismuth.md` back to the root level.
12. Remove the directory `bubbled-gems`.
13. Move all files (but not directories!) that are on the root level into a new directory called `homeworld`.


### And you're done!
