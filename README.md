# Steven Bashiverse

An exercise in file-management BASH commands.


### Introduction

This lab is mostly about managing a file system by creating, moving, copying, and deleting files and directories from your system.

The rest of it is about how much I love [Steven Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe).

### Project Workflow

* You'll start by forking this repository and cloning it.
* After that, you'll follow the steps below, `add`ing and `commit`ting after _every single step_. Once again, we're looking for a commit (which is recorded in your repo's history, so we can see it!) for every single numbered step below!
* What kind of commit messages should you have? Think about it before you start committing!
* Feel free to `push` up as you go, but however often you `push` up, be sure to do so before the assignment is due!
* Be absolutely sure that your spelling and punctuation for the file and directory names match the specifications _exactly_.


### Steps To Follow

1. Create files called:
   * `rose-quartz.md`
   * `pearl.md`
   * `amethyst.md`
   * `garnet.md`
   * `jasper.md`
   * `connie.md`
2. Create a directory called `opal` and _copy_ `pearl.md` and `amethyst.md` into it.
3. Create a directory called `sugilite` and _copy_ `garnet.md` and `amethyst.md` into it.
4.  Create a directory called `sardonyx` and _copy_ `garnet.md` and `pearl.md` into it.
5.  Create a directory called `alexandrite` and _copy_ `garnet.md`, `pearl.md`, and `amethyst.md`.
6.  Create a directory called `bubbled-gems` and create a file called `bismuth.md` in it.
7.  _Move_ `bismuth.md` into the root level of the repository.
8.  Change the name of `rose-quartz.md` to `steven-universe.md`.
9.  Create a file called `ruby.md` and another called `sapphire.md` and remove `garnet.md` from the root level.
10. Create a directory called `stevonnie` and _copy_ `steven-universe.md` and `connie.md` into it.
11. _Move_ `jasper.md` to `bubbled-gems`.
12. Remove the directory `bubbled-gems`.
13. Move all files (but not directories!) that are on the root level into a new directory called `homeworld`.
14. And you're done!
